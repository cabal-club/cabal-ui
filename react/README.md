# cabal-ui react components

ðŸš§ This project is a work in progress at the moment. ðŸš§

The goal of this project is to provide a component library for any cabal client and a fully functioning frontend for both `Cabal Desktop` and a future `Cabal-in-the-browser client`.

## How to get started

For now, you can check out all of the components in the storybook by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/cabal-club/cabal-ui.git
cd cabal-ui/react
npm i
npm run storybook
```


## How it can be used

```
* render process *
